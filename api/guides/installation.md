## Installation

First, make sure you use the latest software.

* Node.js > v10.x
* NPM > v6.x
* Browser with ES6 support

This guide assumes an intermediate level knowledge of TypeScript and at least a basic understanding of the difference between currencies and assets. Basic comprehension of distributed ledger technology and frameworks is welcome but not required.

We recommend you employ the client module as an NPM package in your application.

```shell
$ npm i --save @0xcert/client
```

On our official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/0xcert/framework), we also host a compiled and minimized JavaScript file that you can directly include in your website. Please refer to the [API](/api/core.html) section to learn more about asset ledger.
