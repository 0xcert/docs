# Use Cases

Similar to the 0xcert Framework, the 0xcert API can be used to cover a multitude of different use cases. Below is just a handful of applications because new cases are poping up on a almost daily basis.

## Digital Collectibles

The space of non-fungible tokens got kick started with CryptoKitties, cute cats represented on the Ethereum blockchain as unique tokens. This paved the way to a proliferation of ideas and different applications, but the core principle remained the same: truly own a collectible in the digital world. To this day, digital collectibles are the most well known and prevalent use case of non-fungible tokens. 

The main feature and advantage of digital collectibles is that it created a whole new asset class on the blockchain and showed how powerful the concept of true digital ownership really is. Today we have many different collectibles, ranging from simple to highly complex that involve licencing deals with clubs. brands, leagues, etc. 

## In-game Assets

Applications of non-fungible tokens in gaming are an extension of the above described digital collectibles use case. Traditionally in-game assets are owned by the development company and usually can’t  be freely traded. The concept of true digital ownership introduces a completely new persepctive where in-game assets can be decoupled from the game itself, empowering the gamer and potentially even providing new monetization routes. 

## Digital Art

Again, similar to the digital collectibles use case is digital art. Recently, digital art has seen a surge in adoption and trading. Concepts of true digital ownership and digital scarcity drive artists to create unique pieces of art in the digital world and on the other hand also create demand among users. 

## Certificates

Certification is widely used to enforce certain standards, demonstrate achievements or compliance. Certificates can inform about business operations (ISO), social responsibility (Fairtrade), credit ratings, and many more. Blockchain-based certificates can reinforce trust by preventing data mismanagement, content forgery or authenticity abuse. They add transparency by enabling public access and verification mechanisms previously impossible. 

In general, blockchain certificates can add speed, safety and effeciveness to the certification issuance and verification process. This in turn optimizes business processes and has a positive effect on the bottom line, in addition to providing new ways of monetizing digital certificates. 

## Education Credentials

Qualifications of learning achievements are valuable documents validating a unique set of acquired skills and knolwedge. They range from academic degrees, diplomas, PhDs, ECTS points, micro-credentials, MOOC course badges and others. 

Similar to the certification use case, blockchain can reinforce trust and add transparency with education credentials as well. Fraud and abuse of academic achievements is well documented and in dire need to be adressed on a systemic level - blockchain can provide the backbone for this transformation. 

## Supply chain 

Supply chains are essential parts of the modern economy. They connect an array of producers, distributers, storages, documents, and means of transportation, following specific standards and processes. Supply chains are becoming increasingly complex, difficult to manage and complicated to audit as they often span not only many companies but multiple industries. 

Assets within a supply chain (parts, lots, serialized containers, documents, etc.) can be efectively tracked and traced with the use of blockchain and non-fungible tokens. This can boost trust and transparency but also decrease frictions among multiple stakeholders within a supply chain.  

## Intellectual Property 

Creative industries, such as design, fashion and photography often have to deal with IP protection. In order to guarantee that their intelectuall pripoerty will be safeguarded, creatives have to go through a process of IP protection. Blockchain can offer a way to definitely prove when something has happened and who is the rightfull owner of certain IP rights. Non-fungible tokens are ideal, not only to reinforce trust and prevent copyright infringements, but also to provide a undeniable trail back to it's original creator. 

## Physical Art

Fine art is a one-of-a-kind manifestation of artists' creative genius. Yet too often, the art market is challenged by increasingly advanced cases of forgeries of artworks, their provenance and authenticity. Similar to supply chain, prooving provenance can be essential for a piece of art and blockchain can assist with that in the digital world. 

Having proofs of authenticity and authorship secured on the blockchain as non-fungible tokens adds indisputable trust, transparency and protects it from forgeries. 

## Tickets and Coupons 

The ticketing industry is large and diverse with a set of specific problems yet to be solved. One that can be addressed with blockchain is scalping. Blockchain-based tickets have a built-in way to be tracked and traced back to its origin. This alows for better control of the ticket journey, even if there are many stakeholedrs involved in it's distribution and revenue sharing. 

Another great use case for tickets are event memorabilia and digital merchandise. In addition to buying the latest Metallica t-shirt, fans can also digitally own unique merch from their favourite bands, artists,...

## Domain names

As demonstrated with ENS, domain names can well be translated into non-funbigle tokens. The usage of NFTs can create more liquid and transaprent markets with native blockchain technology. This can in turn fuel vibrant secondary markets and drive adoption. 

## Invoices and Factoring

Invoices are an essential part of the sales and purchasing process. They are unique to the specific transaction and can subsequently used for reinbursements, returns, warranty,... Unfortunately they are also highly susceptible to forging, which can result in high damages and tedious legal processes. 

With help of non-fungible tokens, they can become unique representations on the blockchain. This can add trust and transparency, but more importantly it can shield companies from irreparable damage. 

## Contracts and Agreements

These legally binding documents hold unique information about signatories, their legal obligations, and rights. Employment and hire contracts, purchase and lease agreements, and letter of intents of all kinds shape daily business relations on a legal scale.

Blockchain can not only help with trust reinforcement but also various kinds of automations. Smart contracts can help create flows for document access as well as execute actions if certian conditions are met or not. 

## Deeds and ownership

Although most of the cases described above represent some form of ownership, it is important to note that the concept also extends to cases like real estate ownership, car ownership, etc. Such cases can range from fairly simple ones to very complex ones like for instance real estate deeds, which is a highly regulated market and often has strict rules how ownerhip is represented and how it is transfered. Nonetheless, NFTs are the best possible way to represt deeds in the digital world.  

## Identity

Digital identity is a hard nut to crack, but non-fungible tokens can provide one possible solution. Identity is most often tied to a KYC record (based on an ID or passport), which in itself is a very sensitive and demanding mechanism. 

By introducing NFTs, identity can become a much larger system of identification or even self-sovereignty. Depending on the model, NFTs from different areas can be used together to provide some form of identity. We can further introduce such identities in frictionless systems where no sign-in is required since the identification is already present in a digital wallet.

## Elections and Democracy 

Similar to the ticketing use case, NFTs can be used for voting in elections. This use case closely ties into the one mentioned above, identity. In general, blockchain can be used to power elections and other democratic process, enhancing them with aditional trust, transaprency and security. 

## DeFi

Decentralised Finance is an up and coming topic where NFTs play an ever more important role in creating advanced financial instruments. Therefore DeFi on it's own is not something that can be tokenized, but rather provides additional utility for certain unique digital assets. For example, tokenized invoices can be used to create a decentralised factoring model, where DeFi provides the necesarry liquidity. NFTs can also be used as loan collateral - similar like they are used now in the analog world.
