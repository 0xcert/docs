# Get credits

## No ETH transaction

Since the user does not actually perform a transaction on the blockchain but only signs it with their wallet, they do not need any ETH. 0xcertAPI handles all the transaction payments, and everything around it to make sure it completes successfully. 0xcertAPI however does charge for transactions - with credits.

## ZXC is the new Credit

With release of 0xcert Framework 2 and its companion 0xcert API, we've utilized our community backed ZXC tokens and used them as a **payment medium** of 0xcert ecosystem. 

Each ZXC token in 0xcert ecosystem holds its **initial value of 0.043€**, and can be converted into **one credit** of the same value. (Under the hood, a credit unit is also a dapp token, which we gave a meaning name.) 

## Usage

Credits are the core of 0xcert API and can be used for various services, including:

  * Asset creation
  * Transfer of assets	
  * Transfer of value	(tokens)
  * Asset updates
  * Ledger abilities settings
  * Asset ledger deployment
  * Value ledger deployment

The best part of using Credits is that each action on 0xcert API is performed in a safe and proven way, and have always the same cost, regardless of the blockchain's current gas price. On top of all, you don't ever need to spend your valuable ETH.

## How to get credits

There are two ways of getting credits:

1. Buy credits directly with a credit card.
2. Exchange ZXC tokens for credits.

Both ways are available on [0xcert API Dashboard](https://dashboard.0xcert.org) under `Deposit` button in Balance window.

The second, ZXC option to get credits is not available in the test mode, since you can get test credits with a credit card **for of charge**. Just follow the next section.

### Buy credits with credit card

In [0xcertAPI dashboard](https://dashboard.0xcert.org) you have a deposit option which asks you how you would like to get tokens. If you choose credit card you can select the amount and directly get credits. Exchange rate for credits is 0.042€ which means, that for 1€ you get roughly 23,8 credits. Note that credit card payment provider charges 0.5€ fee per deposit.

### Exchange ZXC for credits

If you own ZXC tokens you can exchange them for credits in the ration 1 ZXC = 1 credit. This option is only available on mainnet. Once out of beta, you'll be able to simply select amount of ZXC you want to convert to credits and hit convert. In couple of minutes your balance will be filled with selected amount of credits.

## Withdrawal

Credits you no longer need, can be simply withdrawn back to ZXC tokens and into your wallet, in the same 1:1 ratio. To do that, hit the `Withdraw` button in balance window and define how much credits you like to withdraw and click proceed.
