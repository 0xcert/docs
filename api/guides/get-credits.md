# Get credits

## NO ETH transaction

Since the user does not actually perform a transaction on the blockchain but only signs it with their wallet they do not need any ETH. 0xcertAPI handles all the transaction payments and everything around it to make sure it completes successfully. 0xcertAPI however does charge for transactions. You can read more about this in the [Get credits]() section.

## How to get

There are two ways of getting credits

1. Buy credits directly with a credit card.
2. Exchange ZXC tokens for credits.

### Buy credits with credit card

In [0xcertAPI dashboard](https://dashboard.0xcert.org) you have a deposit option which asks you how you would like to get tokens. If you choose credit card you can select the amount and directly get credits. Exchange rate for credits is 0.042 which means that for 1â‚¬ you get roughly 23,8 credits.

### Exchange ZXC for credits

If you own ZXC tokens you can exchange them for credits in the ration 1 ZXC = 1 credit. More information on how to do this will be available when the 0xcertAPI comes out of beta.
